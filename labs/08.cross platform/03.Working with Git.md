# WORKING WITH GIT

In this exercise, you are going to learn how to put some existing code
into your Team Project. This exercise assumes you have completed
[Exercise 1](https://github.com/PlainConcepts/DevOps-Immersion/blob/master/devops/experience_g_crossplatform/story_a_crossplatform/content/1.Setting%20up%20a%20new%20project%20on%20VSTS.md), and have created a Team Project that uses Git for version
control and have completed [Exercise 2](https://github.com/PlainConcepts/DevOps-Immersion/blob/master/devops/experience_g_crossplatform/story_a_crossplatform/content/2.Managing%20Backlog.md) where you’ve defined some work
items. This exercise uses a team project named **jdev**, though your
team project name may differ.

## Adding existing code to Git

1.  Connect to the virtual machine with the user credentials which you have given.

1.  Once connected ,open Eclipse from the Launcher by clicking on the **Eclipse** icon.

1.  When the **Workspace Launcher** appears, you can accept the default
    folder or select another one. 
    
    > This is where Eclipse will store  your projects. You can select the **Use this as the default and do
    not ask again** option if you want Eclipse to remember the folder
    and do not prompt every time on startup.

1.  Select **OK** when you are done.

1.  Open the **Team Foundation Server Explorer** perspective. To open
    the Team Foundation Server Exploring perspective:

1.  On the **Window** menu, point to **Open Perspective**, and click **Other**.

1.  In the **Open Perspective** dialog box, click **Team Foundation Server Exploring**, and then click **OK**.
        
    > <pre><b>Note:</b>  Minimize the welcome window if Team Explorer window is hidden </pre>

    <img src="./images/git/image4.png" width="716" height="550" />

    > <pre><b>Note:</b> A perspective defines the initial set and layout of views in the Workbench window. 
    You can create new or customize existing perspectives. If you want to know more, you might find this
    <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/eclipse/eclipse_perspectives.htm">helpful</a> </pre>

1.  If necessary, click the Home icon in Team Explorer window and  click  **Connect to  Team Projects** plugin button.

    <img src="./images/git/image5.png" width="456" height="264" />

1.  If you are connecting for the first time, you may have to accpet the license agreement by chekcing the checkbox given, then click next.

1.  In the **Add/Remove Team Foundation Server** dialog, click the
    **Add** button on the right. 
    
    > Enter the name of your Visual Studio Team Services account plus **.visualstudio.com**. For example, if
    your account name is *javadev*, you would enter *javadev.visualstudio.com* (without any http or https). Once
    you’ve entered your account name, click **OK**.

1.  Once your login is success, Eclipse will open a Secure Storage dialog. 

1.  Enter a password and confirm it in the dialog and click **OK**. It is important to remember master password as it requires everytime you connect to your VSTS account.
    
    <img src="./images/git/image8a.png" width="485" height="373" />
    
    > <pre>Eclipse stores the connection information in an encrypted form in a storage file that is stored with 
    a predefined password. Make sure you can remember this password. Eclipse will offer to allow you to save
    password hints for password recovery. Click Yes or No depending upon your needs.</pre>

## Configuring User Name and Email for Git

Now before you can commit artifacts to the local repo and the push to VS
Team Services, you need to configure your user name and e-mail address
for Git in Eclipse.

1.  Select **Window | Preferences**. Under the **Team** node, select **Configuration** under the **Git** node.

    <img src="./images/git/image28.png" width="1073" height="755" />

1.  Click **OK** to save your preferences.

    > <pre>You’re now ready to take your local changes and commit them locally and then push them up to 
    > your remote repository in Visual Studio Team Services.</pre>

## Committing changes to Git

1.  In the **Project Explorer**, right click on the root node and select  **Team | Commit**. You can alternatively press **CTRL+\#** key

    <img src="./images/git/image30.png" width="909" height="638" />

1.  In the **Commit Changes** dialog, enter a commit message like **Add
    existing files** followed by \#123 where 123 is the Work Item ID
    for one of your PBIs. If you don’t remember the Work Item ID,
    switch over to your open web browser and take a look at the
    Backlog or Task Board.

1.  In the Files section click the
    <img src="./images/git/image31.png" width="19" height="24" /> button to
    select all the files.

1.  Now click **Commit and Push**.

    <img src="./images/git/image32.png" width="695" height="718" />

1.  Once the process is complete, click **OK** to close the **Push Results** dialog.

     <img src="./images/git/image33.png" width="653" height="452" />

    > Let’s see what you can see using the Visual Studio Team Services
    website for the project. Switch back to your web browser.

1.  Click the **Code** link at the top. You can see the code you just
    pushed into the repository.

    <img src="./images/git/image34.png" width="610" height="495" />

1.  Click the **History** tab to see the information on the push you
    just performed.

1.  Click the **Explorer** link, and then expand the **src** folder
    under the **jdev** root until you find the **DataAccess.java**
    file (jdev/src/main/java/com/microsoft/example). 
    
1.  Select that file.

    <img src="./images/git/image35.png" width="764" height="453" />

1.  You can easily browse the file. As you can see Visual Studio Team
    Services understands that this is a particular type of file and
    applies syntax formatting.

1.  Select the root **jdev** node.

1.  Leave your browser open and on the current page. Continue to the [next exercise](https://github.com/PlainConcepts/DevOps-Immersion/blob/master/devops/experience_g_crossplatform/story_a_crossplatform/content/4.Running%20builds%2C%20Unit%20Tests%20and%20Code%20Coverage.md).
